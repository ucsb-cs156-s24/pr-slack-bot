# pr-slack-bot

A repo with the workflow for posting to slack when a pr is merged

TODO: Ahsun, please add the workflow in the .github/workflows folder of this repo.

* Copy over the 82 workflow
* Update it with the channel numbers for the 16 teams in S24 (you may need to join the channels to get the channel numbers... then leave the channel so the students are not confused)
* Update the script with the latest version of the prompt (remember to update both branches, for merged and closed without merging)
* Update the script to make it clear that they should put their reflections in a "reply thread" to the prompt from the bot.
